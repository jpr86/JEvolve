# JEvolve
Java Evolutionary Computation

JEvolve is an evolutionary computation library in java that is designed for flexibility, and includes many "non-standard" 
features, such as contraints, multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA), multi-population, and useful operators. It is
"composable" in that it readily supports creation of new, more complex GA's out of building blocks (pun intended...for those 
familiar with the building block hypothesis). 

JEvolve is frequently used with CHECKMATE in various ways for optimization. A 2005 GECCO paper used a predecessor of
CHECKMATE and JEvolve for automatic discovery of robust and capable mission plans in complex, dynamic environments.
